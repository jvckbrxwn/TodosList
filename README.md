# TodosList

## About me
Hello, I'm Stas and I want to become an iOS developer. For now I'm trying to develope simple apps to learn new features.
In the past I was a Unity Dveloper for 5 years, but from the begining I thought that I would be a mobile developer (not a game developer) :)

## About app
I had an idea to create ToDo app with auth. This is a simple app to add, edit, remove todos with categories.

## What I used here
MVP Design Pattern, Delegate Pattern, Firebase Auth, Firebase Firestore, No Storyboards (I'm trying to write only with code), TableView etc.
